\section{Load balancing revisited}
The approximation ratio that we want to determine is $T/T^*$.

First we state the \emph{problems} lower bounds (without motivation, as they
are considered known).

$$ T^* \geq L $$
$$ T^* \geq A/m $$

Now lets consider the \emph{algorithms} upper bounds. We define $i$ and $j$
as in class: Machine $i$, $m_i$, is the machine that worked until end.
job $j$ is the last job by $m_i$, it took $t_j$ time. 

We know (again from class) that all machines worked for at least $T - t_j$.
As otherwise job $j$ would have been assigned to a different machine,
this can be stated because of "greedy".

Let $k$ be any machine, and machine $k$ totally worked for $T_k$ time.
We just said $T_k \geq T - T_j$. From this follows:

\[
 T_k \geq T - T_j \rightarrow \sum_{k} T_k = A \geq m(T-t_j) \geq m(T-L)
\]

\[
 A \geq m(T-L) \rightarrow A/m + L \geq T
\]

Now we have what we need in terms of upper bounds and lower bounds.
Lets use the inequalities to "solve for" $T/T^*$.

\[
 T/T^* \leq \frac{A/m + L}{A/m} = 1 + mL/A
\]

\[
  \lim_{L/A \to 0} T/T^* \leq 1 + mL/A = 1
\]

We are done.
